{"prompt": "How do I begin fine-tuning a model with this toolkit?", "completion": "To start fine-tuning your GPT model using this kit, consult the README.md file. First ensure you have cloned the repository and installed all dependencies. Navigate to the server directory, set up your environment, and run 'python server.py' to launch the backend. Then, open another terminal, go to the client directory, and use 'npm run dev' to start the frontend. Once everything is up and running, you can begin fine-tuning your model by entering prompts into the web interface."}
{"prompt": "What do I need to install before I can use the fine-tuning kit?", "completion": "Before you can use the GPT-FineTune-Kit, consult the server/requirements.txt file. First you need to have Python 3.8 or higher, Node.js 12.x or higher, and npm installed on your machine. These are essential as Python handles the backend with Flask, and Node.js with npm manages the frontend built with React. Once you have these installed, you can proceed with setting up both the server and client parts of the kit as described in our documentation."}
{"prompt": "I followed all steps but when I try to run server.py, I get a 'module not found' error. What should I do?", "completion": "If you're encountering a 'module not found' error when trying to run 'server.py', it usually means that some Python packages have not been installed correctly. Please ensure you've activated your virtual environment if you are using one, and run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in the server directory to install all necessary dependencies. If the problem persists, check that you are in the correct directory and that the 'requirements.txt' file is present and correctly formatted."}
